## Detailed Review Notes

### Content Validation (vs Lesson Plan)

**Learning Objectives Coverage:**
1. Derive the integration by parts formula from the product rule - COVERED (Slide 3)
2. Apply the LIATE guideline to choose u and dv strategically - COVERED (Slides 7-8)
3. Execute the integration by parts procedure: integral u dv = uv - integral v du - COVERED (Slides 9-11)
4. Recognize when multiple applications of IBP are needed - COVERED (Slides 12-13)
5. Solve cyclic integrals algebraically when IBP returns to the original - COVERED (Slides 14-15)

**Common Misconceptions Addressed:**
- Choosing u and v directly instead of u and dv - Addressed (Slides 6, 19)
- Forgetting the minus sign - Addressed (Slide 19)
- Stopping too early on multiple-application integrals - Addressed (Slides 12-13, 19)
- Giving up on cyclic integrals - Addressed (Slides 14-15, 19)

### Notes

Comprehensive BC-only presentation covering integration by parts. The LIATE guideline is presented memorably with clear visual hierarchy. The cyclic integral technique (Slides 14-15) is particularly well explained with the algebraic solving approach. The tabular method (Slides 16-17) provides efficiency for repeated applications. Strong emphasis on the distinction between choosing u/dv and computing du/v throughout.
