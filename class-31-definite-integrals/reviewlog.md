## Detailed Review Notes

### Content Validation (vs Lesson Plan)

**Learning Objectives Coverage:**
1. Write and interpret definite integral notation - COVERED (Slides 2-3)
2. State and apply properties of definite integrals - COVERED (Slides 5-8)
3. Interpret definite integral as signed area - COVERED (Slides 4, 9)
4. Evaluate definite integrals using geometry - COVERED (Slides 10-11)
5. Understand the connection to Riemann sums - COVERED (Slides 2-3)

**Common Misconceptions Addressed:**
- Signed vs unsigned area - Explicitly addressed
- Integral as "anti-derivative" only - Clarified as net accumulation
- Properties confusion (additivity, linearity) - Step-by-step examples
