## Overview

This synthesis presentation brings together all derivative analysis techniques to sketch curves and transfer fluently between f, f', and f'' representations. Students will master the relationships between these three functions and develop systematic curve sketching skills that integrate domain analysis, asymptotes, monotonicity, concavity, and key points.
