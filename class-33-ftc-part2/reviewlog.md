## Detailed Review Notes

### Content Validation (vs Lesson Plan)

**Learning Objectives Coverage:**
1. State FTC Part 2 (Evaluation Theorem) - COVERED (Slides 2-3)
2. Use antiderivatives to evaluate definite integrals - COVERED (Slides 4-7)
3. Apply the net change interpretation - COVERED (Slides 8-9)
4. Connect the two parts of FTC - COVERED (Slides 10-11)
5. Solve applied problems using FTC Part 2 - COVERED (Slides 12-14)

**Common Misconceptions Addressed:**
- Forgetting to evaluate at both bounds - Emphasized in examples
- Sign errors when subtracting F(a) from F(b) - Step-by-step work shown
- Confusing "+C" usage (not needed for definite integrals) - Explicitly mentioned

### Spec Verification

**Slide Inventory Check:**

### Technical Check

- [x] TOC overlay present
- [x] Proper fonts loaded
- [x] D3.js loaded
- [x] MathJax loaded
- [x] Theme color matches Unit 6
- [x] Keyboard navigation functional

### Notes
Strong presentation that builds on FTC Part 1. The net change interpretation connects abstract mathematics to physical applications effectively.
