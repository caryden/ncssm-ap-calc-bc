## Detailed Review Notes

### Content Validation (vs Lesson Plan)

**Learning Objectives Coverage:**
1. Construct slope field from differential equation - COVERED (Slides 3-6)
2. Interpret slope field as visual representation - COVERED (Slides 7-8)
3. Sketch solution curves that follow slope field - COVERED (Slides 9-11)
4. Match slope fields to differential equations - COVERED (Slides 12-14)
5. Identify equilibrium solutions from slope field - COVERED (Slides 15-16)

**Common Misconceptions Addressed:**
- Drawing solution curves that cross slope segments - Clear guidance
- Confusing slope field with solution curves - Distinction emphasized
- Equilibrium solutions (horizontal lines) - Well illustrated
