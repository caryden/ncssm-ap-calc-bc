## Detailed Review Notes

### Content Validation (vs Lesson Plan)

**Learning Objectives Coverage:**
1. Calculate average value using formula f_avg = (1/(b-a)) * integral - COVERED (Slides 2-4)
2. Interpret average value geometrically as equal-area rectangle height - COVERED (Slides 5-6)
3. State and apply Mean Value Theorem for Integrals - COVERED (Slides 7-8)
4. Define and evaluate accumulation functions F(x) = integral from a to x - COVERED (Slides 9-11)
5. Apply FTC to find derivatives of accumulation functions - COVERED (Slides 12-13)
6. Interpret accumulation functions in applied contexts with units - COVERED (Slides 14-16)

**Common Misconceptions Addressed:**
1. "Average = (f(a) + f(b))/2" - Counterexample provided
2. "Average value equals the integral" - Division by (b-a) emphasized
3. "Accumulation function is just the antiderivative" - Specific form clarified
4. "F'(x) = f(x) always, no chain rule" - Chain rule cases shown
5. "Average value must be positive" - Negative average discussed
