# Lesson Plan: Course Introduction

## Class 0 | February 2, 2026 | Unit 1: Limits and Continuity

---

## Overview

This introductory session sets the stage for AP Calculus BC by exploring the fundamental question: **Can change occur at an instant?** Students will discover that calculus is the mathematics of change and accumulation, built on the concept of limits.

**CED Topic:** 1.1 - Introducing Calculus: Can Change Occur at an Instant?

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this class, students will be able to:

1. Explain why calculus is necessary for understanding instantaneous change
2. Distinguish between average rate of change and instantaneous rate of change
3. Describe how a limit allows us to define instantaneous rate of change
4. Navigate the course structure and understand expectations

## Materials Needed

- Presentation slides
- Desmos graphing calculator (for demonstration)
- Student devices for interactive exploration
- Syllabus handout (optional)

## Class Structure (50 minutes)

### Opening Hook (8 min)

**The Speed Trap Problem**

Present this scenario:
> A car drives through a 2-mile school zone. A camera captures the car at 10:00:00 AM at mile marker 0, and another camera captures it at 10:02:00 AM at mile marker 2. The speed limit is 25 mph. Can the driver be ticketed for speeding?

**Discussion questions:**
- What was the car's average speed? (60 mph)
- Does this mean the car was going 60 mph at any particular moment?
- Is it possible the car never exceeded 25 mph? (No - explain why)
- How fast was the car going at exactly 10:01:00 AM?

**Key insight:** Average speed ≠ speed at an instant. But how do we even define "speed at an instant"?

### Core Concept: The Problem with Instantaneous Change (12 min)

**Speed = Distance / Time**

But at an instant:
- Distance traveled = 0
- Time elapsed = 0
- Speed = 0/0 = ???

**This is the fundamental problem calculus solves.**

**Interactive Visualization:** Use the secant line animation to show:
1. A curve representing position over time
2. Two points on the curve defining average velocity
3. What happens as the points get closer together
4. The tangent line emerging as the "instantaneous" slope

**Introduce the concept:**
> The limit is calculus's way of handling "infinitely close" without division by zero.

### The Big Ideas of AP Calculus (10 min)

Present the three Big Ideas:

1. **Change (CHA)**: Derivatives measure instantaneous rates of change; integrals measure accumulated change

2. **Limits (LIM)**: The foundation that makes it all work mathematically

3. **Analysis of Functions (FUN)**: Using calculus to understand function behavior

**Connection:** Show how today's "instantaneous speed" question connects to the derivative, which connects to limits.

### Course Overview (10 min)

Walk through:
- Course structure (10 units, 64 sessions)
- The journey from limits → derivatives → integrals → series
- BC-only content (Units 9 & 10, plus topics in Units 6-8)
- Assessment structure and AP exam format
- Resources and expectations

**Emphasize:**
- The Rule of Four (G.N.A.W.): Every concept graphically, numerically, analytically, verbally
- Active learning expectations
- Technology use (calculators, Desmos, GeoGebra)

### Interactive Exploration (8 min)

**Desmos Activity:** "Approaching the Tangent Line"

Students use Desmos to:
1. Graph f(x) = x²
2. Plot the point (1, 1)
3. Add a slider for h
4. Plot the secant line through (1,1) and (1+h, (1+h)²)
5. Observe what happens as h → 0

**Guiding questions:**
- What is the slope of the secant line when h = 1? h = 0.1? h = 0.01?
- What pattern do you notice?
- What do you think the slope of the tangent line is?

### Closing (2 min)

**Exit Ticket:** In your own words, why can't we simply "plug in" t = 0 to find instantaneous velocity?

**Preview:** Tomorrow we'll formally define limits and learn the notation that makes all of this precise.

---

## Differentiation Strategies

### For students who need more support:
- Pair with stronger students during Desmos exploration
- Provide a completed table of secant slopes for reference
- Focus on the intuition rather than notation

### For advanced students:
- Ask: Can you write a formula for the secant slope in terms of h?
- Challenge: What if f(x) = x³ instead? What would the pattern be?
- Extension: Research Zeno's paradox and its connection to limits

---

## Common Misconceptions to Address

1. **"Instantaneous means at exactly one point in time"**
   - Address: Instantaneous rate of change is still about change, which inherently requires comparison

2. **"We can't divide by zero, so calculus is just approximation"**
   - Address: Limits give us exact answers, not approximations

3. **"Average speed and instantaneous speed are the same thing"**
   - Address: The speed trap example shows they can be very different

---

## Assessment Notes

- Observe student engagement during the Desmos activity
- Exit ticket provides formative data on conceptual understanding
- No formal assessment this session - focus is on motivation and overview

---

## Connections

**Prior knowledge:**
- Slope of a line
- Average rate of change
- Function notation

**Future connections:**
- This session sets up the formal definition of limit (Classes 1-4)
- The tangent line problem leads directly to derivatives (Unit 2)
- The area problem (not covered today) leads to integrals (Unit 6)

## Reflection Questions (for instructor)

After class, consider:
1. Did students seem motivated to learn calculus?
2. Were they able to articulate why limits are needed?
3. Did the Desmos activity work smoothly? Adjustments needed?
4. Any students who seem anxious about the course?
