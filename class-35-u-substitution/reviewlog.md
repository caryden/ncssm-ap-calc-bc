## Detailed Review Notes

### Content Validation (vs Lesson Plan)

**Learning Objectives Coverage:**
1. Explain u-substitution as the reverse of the chain rule - COVERED (Slides 2-4)
2. Identify appropriate u-substitutions by recognizing composite function structures - COVERED (Slides 5-7)
3. Perform complete u-substitution: replace all x-expressions with u-expressions - COVERED (Slides 6, 8-12)
4. Evaluate indefinite integrals using u-substitution with proper back-substitution - COVERED (Slides 8-12, 21-22)
5. Evaluate definite integrals using u-substitution (changing bounds or back-substituting) - COVERED (Slides 14-16, 23-24)

**Common Misconceptions Addressed:**
- Forgetting to convert dx to du - Addressed (Slide 20)
- Forgetting to back-substitute - Addressed (Slides 6, 20)
- Coefficient errors - Addressed (Slides 9-10)
- Mixing x and u in the same integral - Addressed (Slide 20)

### Notes

Strong presentation connecting u-substitution to the chain rule. The visualization on Slide 13 effectively shows how integral parts transform under substitution with color coding (blue for u, green for du). Both definite integral approaches (changing bounds vs back-substitution) are clearly presented. Pattern recognition tables on Slides 17-18 provide good AP exam preparation.
