## Summary

**Overall Status: PASS**

This presentation effectively teaches the inverse function derivative formula. The derivation using implicit differentiation connects to the previous lesson, and the graphical insight about reciprocal slopes provides intuition. The table-based example (Slide 10) addresses a common AP exam format. All three common misconceptions from the lesson plan are explicitly addressed.

**Slide Count:** 17 slides (0-16)
