## Course Overview

AP Calculus BC is a rigorous, college-level mathematics course covering the equivalent of two semesters of college calculus. This course builds a deep understanding of calculus concepts through the **Rule of Four**: exploring every topic graphically, numerically, analytically, and verbally.

This combined AB/BC course covers all Calculus AB content plus BC-exclusive topics including advanced integration techniques, parametric and polar functions, vector-valued functions, and infinite series. Students who complete this course are prepared for the AP Calculus BC exam, which provides both a BC score and an AB subscore.

### Course Philosophy

**"Calculus is the mathematics of change and accumulation."**

We approach calculus not as a collection of formulas to memorize, but as a powerful framework for understanding how quantities change and accumulate. Every concept connects to real-world phenomena—from the motion of planets to the spread of diseases to the optimization of systems.

Our classroom emphasizes:
- **Conceptual Understanding**: Know *why* before *how*
- **Multiple Representations**: See every concept four ways (G.N.A.W.)
- **Active Learning**: Discover through exploration, not just instruction
- **Technology Integration**: Desmos, GeoGebra, and interactive visualizations
- **AP Exam Readiness**: Rigorous preparation for both MC and FRQ sections

## The Three Big Ideas of AP Calculus

### Big Idea 1: Change (CHA)
Using derivatives to describe rates of change and definite integrals to describe net change. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus connects differentiation and integration.

### Big Idea 2: Limits (LIM)
Limits are the foundation of calculus. Continuity, derivatives, and integrals are all defined through limits.

### Big Idea 3: Analysis of Functions (FUN)
Mathematical analysis and reasoning allow us to draw conclusions about functions that are always true, connecting different representations.

## Mathematical Practices

Throughout the course, students develop four essential mathematical practices:

| Practice | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **1. Implementing Mathematical Processes** | Determine expressions and values using mathematical procedures |
| **2. Connecting Representations** | Translate information across graphical, numerical, analytical, and verbal forms |
| **3. Justification** | Provide reasoning and mathematical arguments for solutions |
| **4. Communication** | Use precise notation, language, and conventions |
