## Detailed Review Notes

### Content Validation (vs Lesson Plan)

**Learning Objectives Coverage:**
1. State FTC Part 1 precisely - COVERED (Slide 3)
2. Apply FTC Part 1 to find derivatives of integral expressions - COVERED (Slides 4-7)
3. Handle chain rule cases with variable upper limits - COVERED (Slides 8-9)
4. Interpret F(x) = integral from a to x as accumulation function - COVERED (Slides 2, 10)
5. Connect derivative and integral as inverse processes - COVERED (Slides 11-12)

**Common Misconceptions Addressed:**
- Confusing FTC Parts 1 and 2 - Clear distinction made
- Forgetting chain rule with composed limits - Multiple examples
- Variable of integration vs. variable limit confusion - Addressed with notation emphasis
