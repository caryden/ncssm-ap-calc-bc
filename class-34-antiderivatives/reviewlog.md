## Detailed Review Notes

### Content Validation (vs Lesson Plan)

**Learning Objectives Coverage:**
1. Define antiderivative and understand family of solutions - COVERED (Slides 2-3)
2. State basic antiderivative rules (power, exponential, trig) - COVERED (Slides 4-8)
3. Understand the role of +C in general solutions - COVERED (Slides 3, 9)
4. Find particular solutions using initial conditions - COVERED (Slides 10-11)
5. Recognize indefinite integral notation - COVERED (Slides 2, 12)

**Common Misconceptions Addressed:**
- Forgetting +C - Emphasized repeatedly
- Power rule errors with n = -1 case - Explicitly noted (ln|x|)
- Confusing definite and indefinite integrals - Clear notation distinction

### Notes
Good foundation-building presentation for antiderivatives. The visual representation of the family of curves (vertical shifts by C) is particularly effective.
