## Detailed Review Notes

### Content Validation (vs Lesson Plan)

**Learning Objectives Coverage:**
1. Define differential equation and identify order - COVERED (Slides 2-3)
2. Write differential equations from verbal descriptions - COVERED (Slides 4-6)
3. Verify solutions by substitution - COVERED (Slides 7-8)
4. Understand initial value problems (IVPs) - COVERED (Slides 9-10)
5. Model real-world scenarios with differential equations - COVERED (Slides 11-14)

**Common Misconceptions Addressed:**
- "Solution" means finding a number - Clarified that solutions are functions
- Equation vs. solution confusion - Multiple verification examples
- Ignoring initial conditions - IVP structure emphasized

### Spec Verification

**Slide Inventory Check:**
