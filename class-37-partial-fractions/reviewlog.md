## Detailed Review Notes

### Content Validation (vs Lesson Plan)

**Learning Objectives Coverage:**
1. Recognize when partial fraction decomposition applies - COVERED (Slides 1-3, 6)
2. Set up the correct decomposition form for distinct and repeated linear factors - COVERED (Slides 7-9)
3. Solve for unknown constants using substitution or coefficient matching - COVERED (Slides 10, 12, 14, 16, 20)
4. Integrate each partial fraction term to obtain logarithmic and power functions - COVERED (Slides 5, 13, 14, 17)
5. Apply long division when the rational function is improper - COVERED (Slides 18-19)

**Common Misconceptions Addressed:**
- Forgetting to factor completely - Addressed (Slide 6)
- Wrong form for repeated factors - Addressed (Slides 8-9, key note on Slide 23)
- Improper fractions requiring long division - Addressed (Slides 18-19)
- Integration errors with constants - Addressed (Slide 5)

### Notes

Well-structured BC-only presentation on partial fractions. The opening hook showing fraction addition reversal (Slide 2) effectively motivates the technique. Decomposition templates (Slides 7-9) are clearly presented with the key rule about repeated factors requiring n terms. The progression from distinct factors to repeated factors to mixed factors provides scaffolded learning. Quick reference table on Slide 27 is valuable for AP exam preparation.
